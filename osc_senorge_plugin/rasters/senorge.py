"""SeNorge 2018 daily climate data — BaseDatasetPlugin.

Downloads gridded daily temperature (tg) and precipitation (rr) from the
Norwegian Meteorological Institute's THREDDS OPeNDAP service.

Source: https://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/senorge/seNorge_2018/Archive/
Coverage: Norway only, daily from 1957-01-01.
Native resolution: 1 km x 1 km on UTM33 grid (EPSG:32633).

THREDDS serves annual NetCDF files over OPeNDAP.  The full Norway grid is
always returned — no bbox subsetting at the source.  One plugin period is one
calendar day; the annual file is opened once per year and cached on the plugin
instance so that fetching 365 consecutive days causes only one OPeNDAP
connection per year.  Timestamps are at 06:00 UTC (seNorge convention for
meteorological days).

The source uses uppercase X/Y dims, a ``time`` dim, and 2D auxiliary
longitude/latitude coordinates; ``normalize_period`` handles all of that —
dropping the 2D helpers, renaming to the canonical x/y/t, and reprojecting the
WGS84 bbox onto the UTM33 grid for the spatial clip.
